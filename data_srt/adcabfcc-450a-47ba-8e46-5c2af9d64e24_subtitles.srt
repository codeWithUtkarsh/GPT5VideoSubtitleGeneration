Here’s what you need to do: type an equals sign, choose FILTER, and you’ll get an array. In the array, first select the student range, then type a comma. For the include argument, select the class; after selecting the class, type equals and click the heading. After selecting the heading, lock the range by pressing F4. Close the parentheses and press Enter. Drag it and it will separate automatically. If you like this video, then like and subscribe. Close the parentheses and press Enter; after that, drag it and you’ll see it separate automatically. Isn’t it a great formula?
